Sampling of lectures and coding assignments from Coursera ML course taught by Andrew Ng. 

Thought I'd work through it in my spare time for the fun of it - it's a pretty level and accessible treatment of most of the basic machine learning concepts and algorithms - a really great audit. 

Obviously I hope this isn't used for people to cheat in the course, but I think there are already sources of code public already.
